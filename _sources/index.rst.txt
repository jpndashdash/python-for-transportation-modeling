==================================
Python for Transportation Modeling
==================================

This course provides a basic introduction on the use of Python for
transportation planning and modeling.  It includes a brief review
of the fundamentals of writing code in Python, as well as modules
on tabular data analysis, visualizations, and geographic analysis.
The course assumes that students are already somewhat familiar with
the mathematical tools of transportation modeling in general, and
focuses exclusively on the how these models are constructed and
implemented within Python.

This version of the course is `hosted on Github <https://github.com/jpn--/python-for-transportation-modeling>`_, and thus can be run
from inside `Binder <https://mybinder.org>`_,
a free online server for Jupyter and Python.  The resources available
on this service are limited, and will time-out after a period of inactivity,
deleting all your existing work.  For these and other reasons,
you will not find using Binder to not be a satisfactory solution
for production-level transportation planning and analysis work for
nearly any purpose. However, they are sufficient to run the code demonstrated
in these training exercises, and **you will not need to install anything
on your local machine** beyond a standard web browser, which you
undoubtedly already have.

Click to open these tutorials online in Binder, which will allow you to actually run
the code in a live Jupyter notbook with a Python interpreter.  Alternatively, to run
these files locally on your own computer, you can install Anaconda and download the
`entire directory <https://github.com/jpn--/python-for-transportation-modeling/archive/master.zip>`_
of notebooks and code.
